# Capstone-Project
This is a group project carried out by Yian Wu, Angela Sun and Yiyang Shi. 
This project concentrates on the relationship between world happiness and health using aspects of machine learning.

In this project, we first researched and picked a specific dataset called “World Happiness Report” from the Kaggle website, which includes data on the happiness score’s composition through the years 2015-2019. 
We then normalized the data since the different columns varied on a wide range before normalization.
Then, we assigned the labels and features, and divided the data into training/test sets.
After obtaining and processing the data, we started the coding part of the project. 
We chose to build two different types of models for each year between 2015 to 2019. 
The first type of model is the basic linear regression model and the second type is the neural network model. 
Then, to evaluate our models, we calculated the mean absolute error so that we can clearly see which type of model is more accurate.
Finally, we ran the code and tested our models. 
The final performances of our models are mostly accurate since the mean absolute errors are all below 1%.
